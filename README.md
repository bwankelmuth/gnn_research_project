# GNN research project

The individual folders contain all notebooks, files and datasets belonging to the GNN research project.

## Installation

Install the dependency using the following command.

`pip install -r requirements.txt`

## Folder structure

This project folder is structured the same way as section 4 *Research project: Graph Neural Networks with Economic Applications* of the master's thesis. Specifically, the 7 folders contain the following:

* `0_raw_data`: the raw data and web scraping notebooks described in section 4.1 of the master's thesis.
* `1_data_processing`: the notebooks containing the data preparation and creation of new datasets both explained in section 4.2 of the master's thesis.
* `2_graph_generation`: the notebook containing the graph generation presented in section 4.3 of the master's thesis.
* `3_influencer_determination`: the notebook in which the influencer determination from section 4.4 of the master's thesis is carried out.
* `4_node_classification`: the notebooks implementing the node classification baselines and GNNs from section 4.5 of the master's thesis.
* `5_link_prediction`: the notebooks implementing the link prediction baselines and GNNs from section 4.6 of the master's thesis.
* `6_time_series_forecasting`: the notebooks implementing the time series forecasting baselines and GNN from section 4.7 of the master's thesis.
